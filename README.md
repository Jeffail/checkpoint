==========

This is a Go package providing solutions that can be used in order to convert an offset-based log of discrete data payloads into a queue, where a series of log offsets can be processed and committed asynchronously without the risk of a given offset being prematurely committed.

For more information about how this package functions and the problem it solves check out [this crazy video](https://youtu.be/zd_dtrhjIQ0).

This package is "complete" in the sense that no further development work is planned and any PRs proposing to expand its scope will be rejected. Please report bug fixes and feel free to raise PRs to address them as these will be .
